This code contains a pretty complete set of head movement commands.

mabu.py contains the fundamental control functions.

Run test_mabu.py to make mabu do things.

There are three sets of files. Full movement set, shortened movement set and extra-shortened movement set. 

The naming is as such:

elrs.txt = full set
elrs_t.txt = shortened set
elrs_tt.txt = extra short set

Movement command sets are loaded into memory. Memory is limited on the RPI Pico so a complete set of commands for all 7 motors will not fit. Therefore, the need for the short sets.
